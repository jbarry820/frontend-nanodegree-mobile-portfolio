## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This online portfolio has been optimized for speed! In particular, the critical rendering path has been optimized and this page renders as quickly as possible by applying the techniques picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

The repository was checked out and the code was inspected.

### Getting started

####Part 1: index.html has been optimized to a score of 97 using PageSpeed Insights score

This was started with these useful tips:

1. Check out the repository
1. Inspect the site on your phone, by running a local server

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Frames per Second have been optimized in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, I modified views/js/main.js until my frames per second rate was 60 fps or higher. You will find comments in main.js on how I modified the file.

I found the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

### To use this project with Gulp
* From the root folder type "gulp".
* A folder called "build" is created.
* Run index.html from the "build" folder.
* To test the pagespeed with the minified files that gulp creates:
 ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder/build
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```
* Then
  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder/build
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```
